							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned is how important contrast is in creating visual experiences
								to be accessible for other people. It's important to think about all the different users and audiences that
								interact with a platform, so being able to cater to everyone's needs is so important. Other aspects of design
								like font choice are also critical in making accessible user experiences. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It's so interesting to think about how much power designers and developers have!
								You're almost crafting this digital world and by thinking about accessibility,
								you get to decide who and what kind of people are able to use the platform, so it's so important
								to be intentional about accessible design.
