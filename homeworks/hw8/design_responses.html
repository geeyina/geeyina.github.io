				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I actually was going to write one of my essays on this last semester for my data ethics class! I learned how UI design can be misleading and manipulative of users. Often, it leads them to certain actions or decisions that can be deceptive. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was the breakdown of dark patterns. I thought it was super informative to see the different categories of dark patterns that we might encounter everyday. Super interesting! </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "“When you use the web, you don’t read every word on every page — you skim read and make assumptions. If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another. You can defend yourself against dark patterns on this site.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> 8! Great read, super informative and not something we think about enough! </p>
