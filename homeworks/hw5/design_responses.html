                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned about UI interactions! Not only is it important to think about the visual design of a page, but also how seamlesss the interactions are on the page that also contribute to a clean user experience. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I love the gif of the website where the photos appear in a sort of checkered format whenever they're clicked. That's so cool! I love seeing all the different gifs and how the interfaces may be simple, but it completely transforms the experience.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> From a creative standpoint, I really like the Nike add to cart because it shows how interactions can make an experience more fun and engaging. However, I also really like the maps interaction because it's more simple and not too extravagant, but even then adds a fun and engaging detail to the user experience. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 10! I love this because I would have never thought of some of these interactions since I usually don't think about transitions very much in my designs. </p>
