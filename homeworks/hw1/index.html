<p>Hello, I'm Geena and I love to do crafts, visit gardens, and make art! Outside of school, I like to 
    watch movies, paint, bake, and anything that can be a creative outlet.</p>  

<p>Some things I like to eat are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frozen mango</li>
  <li>curry</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>

  <li>The article emphasizes how important it is to think about the design intent behind a
    certain decision, which is so central to creating meanginful designs! Understanding why an interface
    is organized based on hierarchy, text placement and emphasis, along with other visual elements is super valuable
    to creating visually appealing and intuitive experiences.
  </li>
  <li>I really like the "Breaking Down the App" section because it really highlights how complex and intricate
    interface designs can be, and how we can deconstruct that. I like the gif as well - very engaging!
