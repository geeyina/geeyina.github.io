          <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          <p>Top Dog grew out of a boy's love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants' New York home over the WWII years. Steaks? Tubesteaks! His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far to go to a cart or stand offering kosher style "Franks", usually steeped but better off the griddle.</p>

            <h3>MORE ABOUT US</h3>
            <h4>Top dog™ IS – well, special. And not just that we’ve been selling fine hot dogs in Berkeley, 
              Oakland and elsewhere around The Bay since 1966. Rather, that its originator was introduced by his 
              German immigrant parents to traditional top-quality European-style sausages when only a boy in New York 
              before World War II. Then also there were the many excellent kosher-style frankfurters in hot dogs at 
              pushcarts, stands and restaurants everywhere. Hot dog heaven!  </h4>
            <h4>Top dog™ became the first to offer hot dog fans a choice among a significant variety of quality sausages including the best eastern kosher-style all-beef frankfurter in a memorable bun, our top dog. Onward!</h4>
